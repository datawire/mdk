The Datawire Microservices Development Kit is an open source SDK for
building microservices. The MDK includes native APIs for `service
discovery <https://www.datawire.io/guide/service-discovery-microservices/>`__,
resilience (including `circuit
breakers <https://www.datawire.io/guide/circuit-breakers-microservices-properly-use-hystrix/>`__
and
`deadlines <https://www.datawire.io/guide/deadlines-distributed-timeouts-microservices/>`__),
and distributed logging.

The MDK is *not* a platform; it is designed to augment your existing
webapp framework. For more information, visit https://www.datawire.io.
